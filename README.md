# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The website I created deals loosely with my struggle with high functioning autism.  

Project0 contains 4 .html files as well as a custom sass file and resulting css file(s).  I will break down each file as it pertains to 
it's HTML file.  First, I will go over some bootstrap 4 modules I used in all of my pages.
Navbar was used in each page to make sure you can access all pages for the site from any page on the site.
Jumbotron was used to try and create a header for each page.
Footer was also used on each page.

-index.html
The homepage includes a custom setup of bootstrap called BSD4 which is why I've linked to a custom .css file in my css folder.  I used a navbar, jumbotron, and a container with col's to create a side by side image with text underneath.  A type of "custom card" I suppose.  I also used three buttons to give users an extra way to get to each page.

-heroclix.html
The page on heroclix is where I used sass for the first time.  I was able to use scss variables and inheritance on the page to create a list of favorite pieces. Standard bootstrap was linked to in the head along with a custom sassy.css file for the list. A media query was included in the css in order to make the image disappear on screens smaller than 500 pixels.

-learning.html
I used a card to give the image a little bit of pop.  Standard bootstrap was linked in this file.

-aboutme.html
I used a combination of card, text and a table to display a list of a few of the many guitars I have.  I used standard bootstrap as well as the custom sassy.css file which included inheritance in order to style the text span.

ID's and classes were used liberally throughout the project.  I spent a good amount of time testing different bootstrap components and css styles.  While modern web programming allows far more options than the last time I used HTML, I still found it difficult to place items exactly where I wanted when using bootstrap components.  I found it easier to place components when using simple rows and columns as well as flexboxes in bootstrap.  I will need more practice to get exactly what I see in my mind on the screen without using some trial and error.  Please let me know if this is too informal of a writing style and I can go back and put it into an essay.  Thank you for putting free classes online.
